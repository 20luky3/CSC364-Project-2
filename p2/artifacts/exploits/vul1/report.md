- Category: Cross Site Scripting
- Root Cause: Since we do something like `echo $row['content']` in index.php, it outputs the html exactly as given without sanitizing, and so an attack like <script>alert('hacked');</script> actually runs the script and outputs an alert. This is a simple example, but this could also be extended to malicious scripts. 
- Fix: The patch works because we use `htmlspecialchars()` to escpae the HTML, and now `$content` is escaped preventing any HTML code from running and outputting. Any HTML tag is just treated as text.
