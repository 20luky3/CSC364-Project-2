- Category: Plaintext Password
- Root Cause: With the original like in register.php `$sql="INSERT INTO users(username,password) VALUES ('{$_POST['username']}', '{$_POST['password']}')`, this stored the plaintext passwords in the database without any hashing. Additionally this could be viewed on the user page via user.php, compromising user logins. 
- Fix: In the patch, the passwords are hashed with `password_hash()` and then stored. The login code was also updated to compare hashed passwords instead of plaintext, and the password display was removed from the user page as well.
