- Category: Command Injection
- Root Cause: the `preg_match('/[&|><`$!]/', $host))` line only blocks a few shell special charactersm, and users can still inject a semi-colon followed by another command like `cat` as shown in evidence, or even `rm -rf` 
- Fix: The fix uses `escapeshell()` to convert any shell command into a string literal and so command injection is no longer possible, but for any valid host name it would still work since `ping -c 1 '127.0.0.1'` still works, maintaining the original functionality.
