- Category: SQL Injection
- Root Cause: In login.php, we build a SQL string by concatenating user input like `$sql="SELECT * FROM users 
      WHERE username = '{$_POST['username']}' 
      AND password = '{$_POST['password']}' 
      LIMIT 1;";`
    and then we execute it with `$row=$db->query($sql)->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);` , this can be manipulated by entering a true value like If I input ' OR '1'='1 , then `WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' ` gets queried and it doesn't matter what the password is - this allows anyone to log in as an admin.
- Fix: Instead of string concatenation, we use a prepared statement and execute it `$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username LIMIT 1"); $stmt->execute([':username' => $_POST['username']]);`  which treats the input as a literal value and not SQL code
